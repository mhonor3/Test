# Group-Activity---SOLID-GRASP
Problem Statement
Design a task management system keeping the SOLID and GRASP principles at the forefront of your considerations.

System Requirements:

Project:

A project is a collection of related tasks.
Each project should have a name, description, start date, and end date.
It should allow adding/removing tasks and team members.
Task:

Each task has a title, description, due date, status, and priority.
Think about the different types of tasks you might encounter in a project setting. For instance, some tasks might be recurring, while others could be of high priority and require immediate attention. How might you design classes that can handle these varied requirements without duplicating code?
Consider the relationship between a generic task and specialized tasks. Could there be a base task and then more specific task types?
TeamMember:

Team members have a name and email address.
Team members can join or leave projects.
Some team members might have specific roles or responsibilities within a project. How would you represent a team member who is, for instance, responsible for overseeing a project?
Objective
Design your classes to be both extensible and maintainable. Avoid tightly coupling components, and think about leveraging interfaces and inheritance to achieve this.
Demonstrate how your design complies with SOLID and GRASP principles.
Hints:

Interfaces can help define contracts or behaviors that classes should adhere to, without dictating how they achieve them.
Generalization allows for defining a general form of something, and then creating more specific versions of it. This can be particularly useful for entities that share a lot of common attributes but may have some differences in behavior or additional attributes.
Submission
Each group should submit:

A class diagram showing the relationships, classes, potential interfaces, and any generalizations you identified (this is not required to be in draw.io. it can be hand sketched).
.java files for the code. The code should compile without errors.
A write-up explaining how your design and implementation incorporate the SOLID and GRASP principles.The minimum number of design principles in the write-up should equal the number of team members participating in the assignment. 
Note: The participating team members should be listed in the writeup.
